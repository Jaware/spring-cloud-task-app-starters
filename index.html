Spring Cloud Task Application Starters are [Spring Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) 
applications that may be any process including [Spring Batch](http://projects.spring.io/spring-batch/) 
jobs that does not run forever, and they end/stop at some point. Spring Cloud Task Applications can 
be used with [Spring Cloud Data Flow](http://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/) to create, deploy, 
and orchestrate short-lived data microservices.

{% capture main_content %}

Spring Cloud Task Application Starters are standalone executable applications that can be used for 
on-demand use-cases such as database migration, machine learning, and scheduled operations. 
These applications can run independently on variety of runtime platforms including: Cloud Foundry, 
Apache Yarn, Apache Mesos, Kubernetes, Docker, or even on your laptop.

## Features

* Run standalone as Spring Boot applications
* Orchestrate as data microservices based task/batch pipelines in Spring Cloud Data Flow
* Consume data microservice applications as maven or docker artifacts
* Override configuration parameters via command-line, environment variables, or YAML file
* Provide infrastructure to test the applications in isolation


## Available Applications
